# Requirements
## Telephone Directory Mobile Version Lite

You are to build an application that provides a telephone directory.

The application consists of the following pages:
### Home page

Contains a table containing all the entries.
The page contains a link to the "add new entry" page.

### Add new entry page

Contains a form for entering a new entry.

## Technicalities
### Entries

The application handles a set of entries, that contain a name and a telephone number.

The entries should be validated, so that it's not possible to enter an empty name; and the phone number should be of the form:

+39 02 1234567

That is a "+" followed by a nonempty group of digits, a space, a nonempty group of digits, a space, a group of digits with at least 6 digits.
